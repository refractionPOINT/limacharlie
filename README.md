The open-source version of [LimaCharlie](https://limacharlie.io) has evolved into a commercial offering that includes a fully featured [free tier](https://app.limacharlie.io/signup). The LimaCharlie SecOps Cloud Platform represents a new approach to cybersecurity.

The SecOps Cloud Platform is a construct for delivering the core components needed to secure and monitor any given organization: things like deploying endpoint capabilities through a single agent regardless of the technology, alerting and correlating from logs regardless of the source, automating analysis and response regardless of the environment.

The SecOps Cloud Platform is:

* An environment where many solutions can exist, not as a collection of random tools, but as a series of cybersecurity solutions designed to interoperate in an un-opinionated way, from the ground up; where powerful systems can be put in place at incredible speeds.
* An environment fundamentally open through APIs, documentation, integrability, and affordability; making it a neutral space for all cybersecurity professionals, whether they’re in enterprise, services or vendors to build appropriate solutions.

The SecOps Cloud Platform is not where data goes to die—it’s a fabric, a sandbox ready for you to use, but also ready to disseminate data and insights to other systems as needed in cost-effective ways.
